    <p>Although a siphonophore may appear to be an individual organism, each specimen is in fact a colonial organism composed of medusoid and polypoid zooids that are morphologically and functionally specialized.[4] Zooids are multicellular units that develop from a single fertilized egg and combine to create functional colonies able to reproduce, digest, float, maintain body positioning, and use jet propulsion to move.[5] Most colonies are long, thin, transparent floaters living in the pelagic zone.[6]</p>

    <h2>Siphonophore</h2>
  <p>Siphonophorae (from Greek siph≈çn 'tube' + pherein 'to bear'[2]) is an Order within Hydrozoans, which is a Class of marine organisms within the Phylum Cnidaria. According to the World Register of Marine Species, the order contains 175 species.[3]</p>
  <p>Like other hydrozoans, some siphonophores emit light to attract and attack prey. While many sea animals produce blue and green bioluminescence, a siphonophore in the genus Erenna was only the second life form found to produce a red light (the first one being the scaleless dragonfish Chirostomias pliopterus).[7][8]</p>
  <p>Siphonophores are colonial hydrozoans that do not exhibit alternation of generations, but instead reproduce asexually through a budding process.[9] Zooids are the multicellular units that build the colonies. A single bud called the pro-bud initiates the growth of a colony by undergoing fission.[6] Each zooid is produced to be genetically identical; however, mutations can alter their functions and increase diversity of the zooids within the colony.[6] Siphonophores are unique in that the pro-bud initiates the production of diverse zooids with specific functions.[6] The functions and organizations of the zooids in colonies widely vary among the different species; however, the majority of colonies are bilaterally arranged with dorsal and ventral sides to the stem.[6] The stem is the vertical branch in the center of the colony to which the zooids attach.[6] Zooids typically have special functions, and thus assume specific spatial patterns along the stem.[6]</p>
  <p>Siphonophores typically exhibit one of the three standard body plans. The body plans are named Cystonecta, Physonecta, and Calycophorae.[10] Cystonects have a long stem with the attached zooids.[10] Each group of zooids has a gastrozooid.[10] The gastrozooid has a tentacle used for capturing and digesting food.[10] The groups also have gonophores, which are specialized for reproduction.[10] They use a pneumatophore, a gas-filled float, on their anterior end and mainly drift at the surface of the water.[10] Physonects have a pneumatophore and nectosome, which harbors the nectophores used for jet propulsion.[10] The nectophores pump the water back in order to move forward.[10] Calycophorans differ from cystonects and physonects in that they have two nectophores and no pneumatophore.[10]</p>
  <p>Since their origin, an increase in the number of zooid types has been observed in siphonophores.[11] Scientists have determined two possible evolutionary hypothesis for this observation: 1. As time has gone on, the amount of zooid types has increased.[11] 2. The last common ancestor had many types of zooids and the diversity seen today is due to loss of zooid types.[11] Research shows no evidence supporting the first hypothesis, and has seen some evidence in support of the second.[11]</p>
