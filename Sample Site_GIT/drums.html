    <p>We hear a beating war drums, and then see that itâ€™s being played by a giant  octopus. That octopus is Topo. Topo is a fictional character that has appeared in various comic books published by DC Comics, notable as a loyal sidekick to Aquaman and often aids him and his allies in combat. Topo appears in the film Aquaman, providing drum accompaniment during Arthur and Orm's Ring of Fire combat.</p>

    <h2>Dumbo Octopus</h2>
    <p>Grimpoteuthis[1] is a genus of pelagic umbrella octopuses known as the dumbo octopuses.[2] The name "dumbo" originates from their resemblance to the title character of Disney's 1941 film Dumbo, having a prominent ear-like fin which extends from the mantle above each eye. There are 15 species recognized in the genus.[3] Prey include crustaceans, bivalves, worms and copepods.[2] The average life span of various Grimpoteuthis species is 3 to 5 years.</p>
    <p>Species of Grimpoteuthis are assumed to have a worldwide distribution, living in the cold, abyssal depths ranging from 1,000 to 7,000 metres. Specimens have been found off the coast of Oregon, the Philippines, Martha's Vineyard, the Azores, New Zealand, Australia, California, Gulf of Mexico, Papua, and New Guinea.</p>
    <p>Dumbo octopuses are the deepest living octopuses known, with some specimens captured or observed in hadal depths. One Grimpoteuthis sp. specimen was captured 60 km southeast of Grand Cayman at 7,279 m, but this depth is uncertain (as the specimen may have been captured while the net was descending to depth) [26]. However, in 2020, Grimpoteuthis was spotted 6,957 m deep in the Java Trench, confirming the hadal distribution of this genus.[27] </p>
